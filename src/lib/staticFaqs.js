    "Here's how our planning tiers work:\n\n**Full Planning (₹3–8 Lacs)** — We handle everything from scratch: venue sourcing, all vendor negotiations, contract management, design, guest management, site visits, and post-wedding settlements. Best if you're starting fresh.\n\n**Destination / Luxury Planning (₹8–15 Lacs)** — Same full-service scope, elevated for large-scale destination weddings with a higher staff-to-guest ratio and more intensive on-ground presence.\n\n**Partial Planning** — You've already booked a venue or some vendors; we step in, fill the gaps, coordinate everything, and take complete ownership of execution. Fee depends on scope.\n\n**Venue-Only Sourcing** — If you just need us to find and secure the right venue, we can do that too.",
